                    Human nowadays send a lot of texts and type a lot of words by using these devices. This leads to the major evolution of how human type to sending these texts. 
                    In order to improve user experience, Swiftkey has contributed significant effort to build a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to sending the text on their mobile or tablet devices. 
                    Instead of typing, they can swipe to sending the text. Thus, the main ojbective of this capstone project is to build a predictive text product in R by using Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
                    At the end of this product, it will help to predict the words that user might wants to type and their next preditive word.
                    In this project, we will be using the samples data of Twitter, News and Blogs in this data exploratory session. All the text will be based on English."),
